## Onboarding

Given my history, and giant gap in playing for many years, my first focus is on what I'll refer to as *onboarding* - a period where I:

- assess my skills
- determine my near-term and long-term goals
- start to determine how I'll approach using Scott's Bass Lessons
- determine my practice structure
- review material I should already know in order to fill in gaps and reduce bad habits
