# Initial Post

## Onboarding

Given my history, and giant gap in playing for many years, my first focus is on what I'll refer to as *onboarding* - a period where I:

- assess my skills
- define my near-term and later-term goals
- start to determine how I'll approach using Scott's Bass Lessons
- define my practice structure
- review material I should already know in order to fill in gaps and reduce bad habits
- start the 60-day first cycle of practice

This is to get myself setup for being able to follow through with practice, learning through SBL and keeping focused. And, you know, not sucking.

**Need to make it solidly through 60 days to build habits.**

## Critical Near-term Goals

- Define my practice routine including where I'll store structured notes, duration of practice, structure of practice time
- Improve my practice setup (make it easy to practice, remove obstacles, pick the right location)
- Get setup to record easily so I can review my practice, find issues to resolve and easily share on SBL to get feedback from others
- Create a list of practice songs I already have and am familiar with
- Determine how I'll document my practice and progress

## Other Near-to-mid-term Goals

- Create a list of practice songs for new music, especially recommendations from SBL and others (older music generally)
- Define who I can practice live with since there's only so far I'm going solo (local and otherwise)
- Determine if it's possible to practice live across the net (latency?)

## SBL to Review - Near Term

- Players Path 1-3 (I can already pass these level tests but that comes from my latent piano knowledge, not skills with the bass)
- Finish the fundamentals course
- Create a list of other fundamental courses I should take
- Create a list of courses I'm most interested in for material/skills I definitely don't know/have

## Improvements in my Skills / Questions About Them

- what styles do I have that I should foster versus what styles are bad habits I should kill?
- fix my "continuity of sound" - meaning all notes are the same amplitude/"style." here's where I have some bad habits to correct from playing not amped or too quietly
- ditch my pick hand fingernail sound (hard to avoid the nail sound sometimes, partially b/c of my finger/nail structure)

## A Schedule

The above is all fine and dandy but useless if I don't put some pressure on myself, so here goes:

### On-boarding is wrapped up by the new year

Specifically this means that by 2022/01/04 I will:

- post my initial practice log to SBL
- minimize the barriers to practice (gear, practice time/location)
- complete the fundamentals course and selected my next one
- be practicing learning pathways 1
- know what track recording solution I'll use (ideally have the hardware too)

### February Goals

- I'll be setup to post videos with bass recorded to SBL
- I'll be done with learning pathways 1-2 (not gonna rush it tho)
- I'll have tweaked my practice routine as needed to make sure I am well-focused and happy with the setup (gear, timing, location, documentation)
